IAM(Identity and Access Management)
- is an ID Provider(IDP)
- globally resilient service, any data here is always secure across all aws us regions
- my aws account trusts it's instance of IAM, so, IAM has all authorisation the account and account root user has
- able to create many different identities, all of which are trusted in the same way the account trusts IAM itself
- lets us create 3 different types of identity objects:
  - User
    - Identities which represent humans or applications that need access to your account
    - Is the only Identity that can use IAM Access Keys
  - Group
    - Collection of related users e.g. development team, finance or HR
  - Role
    - Can be used by AWS Services, or for granting external access to your account
    - Generally used when you want to grant access to services in your account to an uncertain number of entities
      - example, using it to allow all ec2 instances to have access to a certain s3 bucket
- Policy(Policy Document) 
  - objects/documents which can be used to allow or deny access to aws services when(only WHEN) they're attached to users, groups, or roles.
  - they just define allow or deny rights for these identity objects
- IAM Access Keys
  - Long-Term Credentials(like username&pw)
  - An IAM user can have up to 2 access keys
  - Can be created, deleted, made inactive or made active
  - Made from 2 parts:
    - Access Key ID
    - Secret Access Key
  - When created, AWS provides both parts, and you're ONLY given access to see the secret access key upon creation.
  - If compromised, have to create a new pair.
  - Can only be used by User Identities

**Availability**
- Global Services
  - What they are:
    - Region-Agnostic: Available across the entire AWS global infrastructure without needing regional setup.
    - Centralized Control Plane: Often have their management (control plane) hosted in a single region, while their data plane (actual user interaction) is distributed globally.
  - Key Examples:
    - IAM (Identity & Access Management): Manages user access and permissions globally.
    - Route 53: Global DNS service to route users to the nearest healthy endpoint.
    - CloudFront: Content Delivery Network (CDN) for low-latency content delivery.
    - WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protects applications globally.
    - Global Accelerator: Routes traffic over the AWS global network for performance. 
  - Why they are important:
    - High Availability & Disaster Recovery: Essential for building fault-tolerant systems, as a failure in one region doesn't stop these services.
    - Simplified Global Management: Allows consistent security policies and configurations across all your deployments.
    - Low Latency: Services like CloudFront and Route 53 bring content and traffic closer to end-users.
    - Scalability: Inherently built for massive scale and global reach.
    - Fault Isolation: Their design prevents a failure in one region from cascading and affecting the entire control plane. 
- Regions
  - What they are: Large, independent, and geographically separated locations around the world where AWS clusters its data centers.
  - Purpose: To provide a physical presence near your customers, support disaster recovery, and meet data residency requirements.
  - Example: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), eu-west-1 (Ireland). 
- Availabilty Zones
  - What they are: One or more discrete, physically isolated data centers within a Region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking.
  - Purpose: To provide high availability and fault tolerance; launching resources across multiple AZs protects against a single data center failure.
  - Connection: AZs within a Region are connected by high-bandwidth, low-latency, redundant fiber optic networks.
  - Example: us-east-1a, us-east-1b are AZs within the us-east-1 Region. 
- Edge Locations
  - What they are: Hundreds of globally distributed Points of Presence (PoPs) that cache content closer to users.
  - Purpose: Content delivery acceleration (CDN), reducing latency by serving static assets (images, videos) from a location near the user.
  - Role: They are for caching and performance, not primary compute/storage like Regions/AZs.
