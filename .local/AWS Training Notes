IAM(Identity and Access Management)
- is an ID Provider(IDP)
- globally resilient service, any data here is always secure across all aws us regions
- my aws account trusts it's instance of IAM, so, IAM has all authorisation the account and account root user has
- able to create many different identities, all of which are trusted in the same way the account trusts IAM itself
- lets us create 3 different types of identity objects:
  - User
    - Identities which represent humans or applications that need access to your account
  - Group
    - Collection of related users e.g. development team, finance or HR
  - Role
    - Can be used by AWS Services, or for granting external access to your account
    - Generally used when you want to grant access to services in your account to an uncertain number of entities
      - example, using it to allow all ec2 instances to have access to a certain s3 bucket
- Policy(Policy Document) 
  - objects/documents which can be used to allow or deny access to aws services when(only WHEN) they're attached to users, groups, or roles.
  - they just define allow or deny rights for these identity objects
