The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a framework that describes the functions and interactions of computer systems in a network. It is divided into seven layers, with each layer responsible for specific functions in data transmission.
Each Layer understands it's layer and all layers below it. Layer 1 only understand(only has layer 1 capabilites) Layer 1 but Layer 3 has layers 3,2, and 1 capability.
  
Networking stack is the software that does each of these functions. Your phone, router, etc all have a Networking stack
***Layer 7 - Application***
You could have a web browser on one side and a router on the other side
Conceptually, any data in the web browser will make it's way through the layers of one side to layer 1 and back up on the other side to the web server software
***Layer 6 - Presentation***
1,2,3 are the Media Layers

4,5,6,7 are the Host Layers
***Layer 4/5 - Transport & Session***

***Layer 3 - Network***

***Layer 2 - DataLink***

***Layer 1 - Physical***
Physical network cards or interfaces
Physical Medium can be Copper(electrical), Fibre(light) or WIFI(Radio Frequencies)
Layer 1 (Physical) specifications define the transmission and reception of RAW BIT STREAMS between a device and a SHARED physical medium. It defines things like voltage levels, timing, rates, distances, modulation, and connectors
  Ensures multiple devices will have a shared understanding of the medium(cable). if the wire between 2 devices send no electrical signal and that means a value of binary 0, and when it does send a signal it means binary 1 then since both devices have a shared understanding of that then they can communicate
  good example is 2 computers wired together with an electrical cable, their network cards would be communicating via those electrical signals
  Hubs can be used to connect more than 2 devices. On a hub: anything received on any port, is transmitted on every other port. Including errors and collisions - this is known as a broadcast medium and it cannot be used for 1 specific device to talk to another specific device. 
    it is possible for multiple devices to transmit data at once, this causes a collision and renders all of the information useless.
    L1 has NO media access control and NO collision detection
Summary:
- focuses on a physical shared medium
- standards for transmitting onto the medium
- standards for receiving from the medium
- no access control
- no uniquely identified devices
- no device -> device communications
- the data layer adds a lot of capabilities on top of this layer
Layer 1, also known as the physical layer,
  is the first and lowest layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a communication channel, such as
  a wire, cable, or wireless signal. This layer defines the physical characteristics of the communication medium, including voltage levels, cable
  types, and signaling methods, to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and reliably between devices.
